# startup
Startup application for CS260. This readme describes the overview of the 
application as well as usage and development notes. See the introduction for setup.

1. Github Assignment

 - I already knew how to use github so I did not learn very much. However it is nice to use GitLens 
 to resolve merge conflicts rather than doing it manually

 2. Startup Deliverable

    Elevator Pitch
        - Canvas Swap is the only place you can get fine art immediatly in your home for 
        under $20. Select from a variety of local artists work to lease into your home. 
        When your lease is up you can purchase the art at a reduced price or swap it out 
        for more art! Place bids, requests, and like art all in the app. Artists
        can also upload and tag their artwork, and reply to customer offers. The biggest 
        painpoint for artists is selling their work and getting it out the door. Most 
        people want Art but it is such a big investement. With Canvas Swap you can get try 
        it out and purchase later if it really hits home.

    App Features
        - Works of art to scroll through that include a leasing price and a suggested purchase price, and
        availability. Each artwork also includes a like button, a bid entry, and a lease request. They may 
        also select a picture frame type. Their account would show personal info as well as what pieces they
        like and what pieces they are leasing or have purchased.

        - On the Artist end, they may upload art, and enter suggested purchase
        prices. They may accept bids from customers as well as leasing pieces out. 
        Their account would show personal info as well as what pieces they have availabe,
        leased out, and sold.

        - Stretch goal would be to add a feature where customers can take a picture of an area in their home
        and project the artwork onto a wall.
